The repo consists of

### Arduino codes for the Arduino UNO used
  a. Phase 1<br />
  b. Phase 2<br />
  c. Sensor calibration : Arduino code to calibrate the fabricated IR sensor array. <br />
  d. Line follower code : Bot follows black line of width >3 cm over white/reflective surface.<br />
    
### NodeMCU codes
   - Consists of NodeMCU code for communication gateway between controller and Arduino using LAN (WiFi).<br />
   - NodeMCU configured as Server and sends the webpages scripts to client upon request.<br />
   - Protected using server-side set password.<br />

### Webpages
   - Webpages scripted in HTML+CSS for communication interface between controller and bot.<br />
   - NodeMCU acts as server.<br />
   - The webpages are integrated into the NodeMCU code as strings.<br />

### Image Processing
   - Python scripts for image processing according to problem statement and communicating with LAN<br />
   - Contains final script and a shape calibration script.<br />

### Bot images
   Major images of self-fabricated sensors, chassis, final version of the bot and the webpages designed.<br />

### Line follower video
